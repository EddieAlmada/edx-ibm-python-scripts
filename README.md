# edx-ibm-python-scripts

This repository contains all Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks developed throughout my EDX course offered by IBM. The collection covers a range of topics including data analysis, machine learning, and advanced Python techniques. Each script is well-documented with explanations and comments to help users understand the context and functionality. This repo serves as a resource for both reviewing course material and for practical examples of Python applications in data science and machine learning.
